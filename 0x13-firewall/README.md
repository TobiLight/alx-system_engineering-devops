# Project: 0x13. Firewall 
This project focuses on the configuration and management of firewalls. Firewalls are essential security components that control incoming and outgoing network traffic, acting as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks, such as the internet. Proper firewall setup is crucial to protect systems and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
